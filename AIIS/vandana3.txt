Dear Dominic, 

I am trying sending smaller images through email. Hope these serve the purpose. Please note the images are more than the data I have sent as I didn’t want to waste time in separating them. 

best, Vandana

Dear Donna, 

I am sorry for the lateness in responding. I had to write some grant requests as soon as I returned which we submitted just last week finally. 

The links you sent are absolutely ideal for related materials on Mughal art and architecture. I am attaching the DB table of the Taj Mahal and Agra fort whereas I will try sending the full set of images through Google drive. Let’s see what results we get. I am already very excited knowing the power of the software Dominic has developed. 

Will revert on the April workshop invite soon. 

regards, 

Vandana

Dear Vandana,

I like this. 

What do Sebastian and Dominic think of the plan and its feasibility? A quick check revealed this in Ash http://jameelcentre.ashmolean.org/collection/4/891 and this 
http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/cultures/asia/mughal_india.aspx inBM 

If one takes 'related info'on that page one gets http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/asia/caves_of_the_1000_buddhas/caves_of_the_thousand_buddhas.aspx 

Since we expect to use Mogao Caves/Dunguang for the China pilot one can begin to see how this could all hang together nicely and illustrate well the initial aim of the project which was showing how Indian and Chinese could be to CLAROS/BM and to each other.

If it was easier for Indian colleagues in this initial pilot we could avoid using objects in any Indian museum. To AIIS photos of Tai complex we could use only BM and C/Ash.

What do you think?

With thanks

Dear Donna, Sebastian and Dominic,

 It would be really nice to have something to show to people in order to explain the project. In fact, if possible, I would suggest to have a sample somewhere in the cyber space that could be shared along with the information and invite for the April workshop. 

I will send the data and images of the Taj Mahal complex by Friday (November 14th, 2014) which is also available currently at http://www.vmis.in/Categories.aspx?ParentID=c2868585-1e35-4a88-8109-2ab783a51d0f This data can be linked with not only Mughal Miniature paintings etc as I wrote earlier (see the extract below from my earlier email), but there are really a large number of areas in which linking is possible such as Tomb gardens of Central Asia and Persia, Pietra dura work, mosque and tombs etc. I am mentioning so many things just to help you find examples from various countries. 

I am available anytime for any assistance  that you might require while developing the presentation for the April event. 

best regards, 

Vandana

(database table of the Taj Mahal Complex which can be cross linked with Mughal Miniature paintings, coins, inscriptions and other types of artefacts of Shahjahan period in the British and Ashmolean Museums. In fact if there are some Chinese paintings (showing golden and orange clouds) those can also be ideally placed in the context of Mughal miniature paintings of Shahjahan period which are considered to have Chinese influence. Similarly, Persian paintings will also provide a great context to the Mughal collections.)

Dear Vandana,

Thank you very much for contacting Dr Katre Dinesh. 
 
I am copying to Sebastian and Dominic since they will meet him in Delhi in April and they have already asked what format we had in mind for the workshop. They will also be taking part in the India and China events in the autumn. We hope Katre will join the India event. 

They can learn more about him easily. He is on YouTube  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrb6QOawbBs ) and  directs CDAC (http://cdac.in/) which the Ministries of Technology and Culture have recognised as a centre for digital technologies and cultural heritage.

He could easily imagine that we want him/Ministry of Culture to 'use' our system. What we actually want them to do is see what we can do with AIIS data as a model and invite them to assess its suitability. 

As you suggest in your message below, seeing some examples could help Katre and the Ministry to understand. Since you will be meeting the Ministry very soon I wonder if Dominic could possibly do that easily/swiftly? 

I like your suggestion of Taj Mahal complex; it is high profile/everyone knows about it. I also very much like your suggestion of linking India with China because it suits the original concept of the AHRC Network of India and China, clearly shows benefits of opening/sharing data, and would enable Sebastian and Dominic to use it not only for the April workshop but also for both autumn events.

With many thanks for these suggestions,

Dear Donna, 

I spoke with Dr. Katre. He was not responding earlier as he had not understood the project. I explained it to him on phone and he seems interested but he said the same thing what I had guessed he would say. He said although they have worked on the GOI’s museum website (http://www.museumsofindia.gov.in) yet they don’t have right to share anything with anyone unless the respective museums are convinced to contribute. I have however told him about the April workshop in which he has agreed to be present. I hope he does. In the meantime we are meeting up with the Ministry of Culture, GOI people in next few weeks including Mr. Srinivas and I will try to let them understand the concept. Is it possible to get access to some kind of a sample website which I can show to people now to demonstrate that how the software would work and how would the networking help? In fact Dominic showed me things which made it easier for me to understand. Can he share something for the purpose? 

I think the April workshop would be helpful regarding this especially if we explain things through examples as administrators as well as IT guys need to get the point. For the April presentation I plan to send database table of the Taj Mahal Complex which can be cross linked with Mughal Miniature paintings, coins, inscriptions and other types of artefacts of Shahjahan period in the British and Ashmolean Museums. In fact if there are some Chinese paintings (showing golden and orange clouds) those can also be ideally placed in the context of Mughal miniature paintings of Shahjahan period which are considered to have Chinese influence. Similarly, Persian paintings will also provide a great context to the Mughal collections. In addition we can do things with our Buddhist collections such as the Sanchi Stupa or Gandhara sculptures. Sanchi stupa sounds easier to me as it’s a monument. As soon as we include museum objects there may be copyright issues. 

Please let me have your thoughts.

warm wishes, 

Vandana
